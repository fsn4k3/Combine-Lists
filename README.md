# Combine-Lists

Hey, my friend,

This tool is designed to combine multiple *.txt files into one *.txt file.

1. Choose all the files you want to combine.
2. Place all selected files in the same folder as combine.py.
3. Open a terminal in this folder.
4. Run the command: `python3 combine.py`

5. You will find the result in result.txt, with all files combined without repetition. :)))
